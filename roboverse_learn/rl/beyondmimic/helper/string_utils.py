    """Match a list of query regular expressions against a list of strings and return the matched indices and names.

    When a list of query regular expressions is provided, the function checks each target string against each
    query regular expression and returns the indices of the matched strings and the matched strings.

    If the :attr:`preserve_order` is True, the ordering of the matched indices and names is the same as the order
    of the provided list of strings. This means that the ordering is dictated by the order of the target strings
    and not the order of the query regular expressions.

    If the :attr:`preserve_order` is False, the ordering of the matched indices and names is the same as the order
    of the provided list of query regular expressions.

    For example, consider the list of strings is ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e'] and the regular expressions are ['a|c', 'b'].
    If :attr:`preserve_order` is False, then the function will return the indices of the matched strings and the
    strings as: ([0, 1, 2], ['a', 'b', 'c']). When :attr:`preserve_order` is True, it will return them as:
    ([0, 2, 1], ['a', 'c', 'b']).

    Note:
        The function does not sort the indices. It returns the indices in the order they are found.

    Args:
        keys: A regular expression or a list of regular expressions to match the strings in the list.
        list_of_strings: A list of strings to match.
        preserve_order: Whether to preserve the order of the query keys in the returned values. Defaults to False.

    Returns:
        A tuple of lists containing the matched indices and names.

    Raises:
        ValueError: When multiple matches are found for a string in the list.
        ValueError: When not all regular expressions are matched.
