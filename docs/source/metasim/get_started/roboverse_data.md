# 💾 RoboVerse Dataset

We store all large trajectory files and assets on [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/datasets/RoboVerseOrg/roboverse_data).

## When Manual Download is Not Required?

You do not need to download the full dataset if you only need to:

1. Try RoboVerse and run example code
2. Develop your own workflow
3. Run existing examples and workflows (an automatic download service is configured that will download required data on-demand during runtime)

## When to Download the Full Dataset?

Please download the complete dataset if you:

1. Want the full experience of RoboVerse's existing datasets and workflows
2. Prefer to avoid downloading data during runtime
3. Have sufficient storage space and time (the complete dataset exceeds 25 GB)
